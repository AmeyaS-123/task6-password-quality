Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords


1.Use Long Passwords
Aim for at least 12–16 characters. Longer passwords are harder to crack.

2.Include a Mix of Characters
Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters (e.g., @, #, !, %).

3.Avoid Common Words & Patterns
Don’t use dictionary words, names, or predictable sequences like 123456, password, or qwerty.

4.Use Passphrases
Create a sentence or phrase that’s easy to remember but hard to guess (e.g., Time2Dance@Night!).

5.Don’t Reuse Passwords
Use a unique password for every account to prevent credential stuffing attacks.

6.Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Adds a second layer of protection beyond just the password.

7.Use a Password Manager
Tools like Bitwarden, LastPass, or 1Password can generate and store complex passwords securely.



Common Password Attacks


Common password attacks include brute force and dictionary attacks, which are among the most frequently used methods by attackers to crack user passwords. A brute force attack works by systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. Although time-consuming, this method is effective, especially against short or simple passwords. On the other hand, a dictionary attack relies on a precompiled list of common words and known passwords to guess the correct one more quickly than brute force. This method is effective against weak or commonly used passwords. To protect against these attacks, users should create long and complex passwords, avoid common words or predictable patterns, and enable security measures such as account lockouts and two-factor authentication.

how password complexity affects security

Password complexity plays a crucial role in enhancing security by making passwords harder to guess or crack using automated attacks. A complex password includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, which significantly increases the number of possible combinations. This makes brute force and dictionary attacks far less effective, as it takes much longer to try every variation. Simple or common passwords can be cracked in seconds, while a complex one might take years with the same method. Therefore, enforcing password complexity helps protect against unauthorized access and improves overall cybersecurity.
